%% The importance of the problem:
%%% Theoretical or practical implications
%% Review of relevant scholarship:
%%% Relation to previous work
%%% If other aspects of this study have been reported on previously, how the current report differs from these earlier reports
%% Specific hypotheses and objectives:
%%% Theories or other means used to derive hypotheses
%%% Primary and secondary hypotheses, other planned analyses

%%%%%%%%%%%% Method %%%%%%%%%%%%
% JARS
%% Participant characteristics 
%%% Eligibility and exclusion criteria, including any restrictions based on demographic characteristics
%%% Major demographic characteristics as well as important topic-specific characteristics (e.g., achievement level in studies of educational interventions), or in the case of animal research, genus and species
%%
%% Sampling procedures
%%% Procedures for selecting participants, including:
%%%% The sampling method if a systematic sampling plan was implemented
%%%% Percentage of sample approached that participated
%%%% Self-selection (either by individuals or units, such as schools or clinics)
%%% Settings and locations where data were collected
%%% Agreements and payments made to participants
%%% Institutional review board agreements, ethical standards met, safety monitoring
%%
%% Sample size, power, and precision
%%% Intended sample size
%%% Actual sample size, if different from intended sample size
%%% How sample size was determined:
%%%% Power analysis, or methods used to determine precision of parameter estimates
%%%% Explanation of any interim analyses and stopping rules
%%
%% Measures and covariates 
%%% Definitions of all primary and secondary measures and covariates:
%%%% Include measures collected but not included in this report
%%% Methods used to collect data
%%% Methods used to enhance the quality of measurements:
%%%% Training and reliability of data collectors
%%%% Use of multiple observations
%%% Information on validated or ad hoc instruments created for individual studies, for example, psychometric and biometric properties
%%
%% Research design 
%%% Whether conditions were manipulated or naturally observed
%%% Type of research design; provided in Table 3 are modules for:
%%%% Randomized experiments (Module A1)
%%%% Quasi-experiments (Module A2)
%%% Other designs would have different reporting needs associated with them

%% Participant flow 
%%% Total number of participants
%%% Flow of participants through each stage of the study
%%
%% Recruitment 
%%% Dates defining the periods of recruitment and repeated measurements or follow-up
%%
%% Statistics and data analysis
%%% Information concerning problems with statistical assumptions and/or data distributions that could affect the validity of findings
%%% Missing data:
%%%% Frequency or percentages of missing data
%%%% Empirical evidence and/or theoretical arguments for the causes of data that are missing, for example, missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR)
%%%% Methods for addressing missing data, if used
%%% For each primary and secondary outcome and for each subgroup, a summary of:
%%%% Cases deleted from each analysis
%%%% Subgroup or cell sample sizes, cell means, standard deviations, or other estimates of precision, and other descriptive statistics
%%%% Effect sizes and confidence intervals
%%% For inferential statistics (null hypothesis significance testing), information about:
%%%% The a priori Type I error rate adopted
%%%% Direction, magnitude, degrees of freedom, and exact p level, even if no significant effect is reported
%%% For multivariable analytic systems 
%%%% (e.g., multivariate analyses of variance, regression analyses, structural equation modeling analyses, and hierarchical linear modeling) 
%%%% also include the associated varianceâ€“covariance (or correlation) matrix or matrices
%%% Estimation problems (e.g., failure to converge, bad solution spaces), anomalous data points
%%% Statistical software program, if specialized procedures were used
%%% Report any other analyses performed, including adjusted analyses, indicating those that were prespecified and those that were exploratory (though not necessarily in level of detail of primary analyses)
%%
%% Ancillary analyses 
%%% Discussion of implications of ancillary analyses for statistical error rates
