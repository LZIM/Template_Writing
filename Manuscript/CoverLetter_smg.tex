\newcommand{\Title}{``Is the Link Between Intelligence and Age at First Intercourse Causal or Correlational?: A Cross-Generational Sibling Comparison Design Using the NLSY''\xspace}

\newcommand{\Authors}{S. Mason Garrison and Joseph Lee Rodgers\xspace}

\newcommand{\Journal}{\textit{Intelligence}\xspace}

\newcommand{\Presented}{This research was originally presented by Joe Rodgers at ISIR in Albuquerque last October}

\newcommand{\Goal}{Several studies, including Halpern \textit{et al.} (2000), have reported a positive relationship between age at first intercourse (AFI) and intelligence in s. Although this link between adolescenct intelligence and AFI has face validity, and has been confidently asserted (or often implied) as a causal link, the causal mechanism has not been carefully investigated}


\newcommand{\Findings}{we used an intergenerational sibling comparison design to investigate the causal link between intelligence and AFI, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the NLSY-Children/Young Adult data. Using a between-family design, we replicated earlier results. However, when we use a within-family design and compare offspring of sisters, and then compare the offspring themselves, the relationship between maternal/child intelligence and AFI virtually disappears}%[list a few important results].
\newcommand{\Scope}{challenges the strong causal inference in past studies concerning the relationship between AFI and intelligence}%specific link to the journal's aims \& scope
