%Participant flow. 
For experimental and quasi-experimental designs, there must be a description of the flow of participants (human, animal, or units such as classrooms or hospital wards) through the study. Present the total number of units recruited into the study and the number of participants assigned to each group. Provide the number of participants who did not complete the experiment or crossed over to other conditions and explain why. Note the number of participants used in the primary analyses. (This number might differ from the number who completed the study because participants might not show up for or complete the final measurement.) The flowchart in the Appendix (Figure 1) provides a useful device for displaying the flow of participants through each stage of a study (see also Figures 5.3 and 5.4, pp. 154-155).
