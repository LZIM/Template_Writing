%Research design. 
Specify the research design in the Method section. Were subjects placed into conditions that were manipulated, or were they observed naturalistically? If multiple conditions were created, how were participants assigned to conditions, through random assignment or some other selection mechanism? Was the study conducted as a between-subjects or a within-subject design?

Different research designs have different reporting needs associated with them. Information that should be reported for all studies that involve experimental manipulations or interventions is summarized in Table 2 of the Appendix, Module A: Reporting Standards for Studies With an Experimental Manipulation or Intervention (in Addition to Material Presented in Table 1) and Table 3 of the Appendix, Reporting Standards for Studies Using Random and Nonrandom Assignment of Participants to Experimental Groups. When reporting studies that are not of the manipulation or intervention variety (e.g., observational, natural history studies), provide sufficient description of the study procedures to allow the reader to fully comprehend the complexity of the study and to be prepared to conduct a near replication of the study.
